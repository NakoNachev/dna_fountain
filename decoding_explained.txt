- first part of the decoding process is to extract indices from the oligos
- this is achieved the following way:
    - extract seed from oligo
    - extract data from oligo (has to be mapped to binary first from dna encoding)
    - create LFSR from the seed
    - now, iterate each state in the LFSR
        - each state corresponds to one index
        - collect all indices (they are equal to the total amount of combinations to form that oligo)
